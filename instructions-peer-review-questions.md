## Peer Review: Assignment One

**For the writer**

Before passing your draft to your peer for review, take a moment to add a comment - either at the top of the document itself, or in a comment. Describe the state of the draft (incomplete, rough, or polished) and what you're most hoping to get feedback on.

**For the reviewer**

In reviewing your peer's draft, be sure to follow all guidelines from the [reading for today](https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/library/peerreview/tips.html). Then copy the questions below and answer them in a comment on the draft.

- Describe the audience for the text. 
  > Is it clear who it is written for? 
  > Could it be clearer? 
  > If it is clear, does the text serve that audience at all points?
- Is the process chosen sufficiently complex to sustain the project, or is it too simple? 
- Could you follow the instructions at all points? 
  > Is there anything you don't understand, or could not follow?
- Does the document include all required elements, or a plan to add them?
