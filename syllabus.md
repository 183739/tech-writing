# Technical Writing

## Course description

The word “technical” derives from the Greek term *technē*, meaning a craft or skill. Historically, this term referred to specialized disciplines like carpentry or cooking, as well as learned skills such as rhetoric. So *technical* writing is writing concerned with such specialized topics: agriculture, information technology, food science. Writing itself is also a *techne*, a skill with knowledge and habits that can be mastered. The technical writer must mediate between demands of the discipline and of writing itself, practicing two different skills at once.

This course focuses on the challenges created by this dual role. Technical disciplines have their own language and conventions which are not always conducive to clear writing, yet the technical writer must still demonstrate knowledge of the discipline while also communicating in a clear, persuasive, and attractive manner.

Effective communication about technical subjects is vital to professionals in any technical field. Even those who do not view themselves as writers must be able to explain themselves and the value of their work to a variety of audiences: managers, customers, regulators, and so forth. A degree of skill in writing can be the difference between success and failure.

Students in this course will have the opportunity to develop their skills in communication and persuasion about technical topics, culminating in a major project of technical communication.

##Course objectives

**Upon completing this course:**

- Students will possess a working knowledge of expectations and norms in professional communication.
- Students will have experience analyzing technical materials and communicating them to a non-technical audience.
- Students will have experience with the rhetorical evaluation of technical materials and document types.
- Students will have received formative feedback in order to build their skill and composing and producing technical documents.

## Course requirements

The work used to assess your performance in this class is as follows:

Documentation: 200 points    
Technical blog: 200 points    
White paper: 400 points    
Participation: 200 points

**Total**: 1,000 points

I will provide detailed assignment sheets for each project at the beginning of the unit.

**Participation**: I expect you to be consistently attentive, engaged, and awake in class. Meeting ordinary expectations for class courtesy—arriving on time, paying attention, staying off your phone—counts for 50% of these points. The additional 50% is earned through active involvement in the class, including contributing to class discussions as well as full participation in class activities such as group work, peer review, and in-class writing. I realize that not everyone is equally comfortable speaking up in class, and I am not looking for a magic number of comments to earn this portion of the grade, but rather evidence of consistent engagement in the class. Because this course focuses on developing a set of skills rather than mastering content, active participation in workshop sessions is vital to your learning.

## Ethical conduct

The following student Honor Code provides a general guideline for behavior: “I agree to be an honest, trustworthy, caring and responsible citizen. I will uphold these values in others and myself.”

Regarding academic honesty, the College has issued the following guidelines:

“College of the Ozarks expects high standards of intellectual integrity from its students. High ideals of scholarship demand that dishonest work be rejected and that those students engaging in such work be punished. Students in violation of the ideals of honesty and scholarship **can expect to receive a failing grade for the class.**

**Cheating** on examinations is (1) borrowing someone’s answers, (2) providing answers for another student, or (3) using unauthorized material during the examination.

**Plagiarism** is the presentation of the words, ideas or opinions of someone else as one’s own. A student is guilty of plagiarism if he submits, as his own work, a part or all of a written manuscript or notes; a part or all of an assignment copied or paraphrased from a source, such as a book, magazine, or pamphlet, without crediting the source, the sequence of ideas, arrangement of material, or pattern of thought of someone else, even though he expresses it in his own words. Plagiarism occurs when such a sequence of words or ideas is used without having been digested, integrated and reorganized in the writer’s mind and without acknowledgment in the paper.

Similarly, a student is an accomplice in plagiarism and equally guilty if he allows his paper, in outline or finished form, to be copied and submitted as the work of another; if he prepares a written assignment for another student and allows it to be submitted as that other student’s work; or if he keeps or contributes to a file of papers or speeches with the clear intent that they be copied and submitted as the work of anyone other than the author.” (College of the Ozarks Student Handbook, p. 56)

In cases of plagiarism, the Dean of the College will be notified and appropriate action taken.

Appropriate classroom behavior is expected of the instructor and all students. Inappropriate and disruptive classroom behavior (inappropriate language and gestures, class disruptions, disrespect to other students, or other behavior determined by the instructor) will not be tolerated and will result in possible removal from the class or disciplinary action as per College policy.

## Attendance

Attend all classes. Unexcused absences and tardies will affect your final grade. Every unexcused absence after 2 will result in a 0 grade on the participation section of the course grade. Each tardy after 4 will result in a 2-point reduction of your participation grade.

Unexcused absences include but are not limited to:

1.  Not attending class or missing more than fifteen minutes of class.

2.  Sleeping in class (or laying one’s head down) is disrespectful to the class community and will not be tolerated. Any student sleeping during class will receive an unexcused absence and may be asked to leave the class.

Excused absences must be approved by Dean of the College. Students whose absences are excused are still responsible for any missed material (This material must be submitted before the expected absence, unless otherwise approved by me.

## Assignment submission

I do not accept late work of any kind. Papers and/or assignments are due in hard copy at the beginning of class on the due date, as well as through any digital means specified in the assignment sheets. I will not accept your assignment if you turn it in and then leave the class without an excused absence, or if you try to send it with another student. If you come to class late, I will not accept your assignment. In-class work or papers may not be made up if your absence is unexcused. 

Papers should be submitted using attractive, professional design choices and a consistent citation style (MLA, IEEE, or another appropriate style). 

## Technology

Proper use of digital technology is integral to technical writing today. However, successful professionals also know how to keep these tools in their proper place. On workshop days, please feel free to work on a laptop or other computer tool. Otherwise, please refrain from use of digital technologies like laptops, smartphones, or tablets unless you have an approved exemption from this policy.

Several of the assignments in this class may require you to learn new software tools including graphic design programs, text editors, and version control software. We will cover general principles for working with these tools in class, but the responsibility for mastering them in order to successfully execute the assignments still lies with you.

In particular, documents for the course will be maintained through GitHub, and you will need to sign up for an account and familiarize yourself with the system.

## Email

Outside of class, I will communicate with you via email, so check your email frequently. Email is the best way to contact me, and I’ll do my best to respond to any question within 24 hours during the workweek. However, make sure to check the syllabus and with your classmates before asking me any basic factual questions. This is simple logistics: the more time I spend telling you things that are already in the syllabus, the less I have to spend on helping you in more substantive ways.

## Learning disabilities

If a student has a disability that requires a special accommodation, the student must notify the professor at the beginning of the semester. In addition, the student must submit appropriate documentation to the Dean of the College.

## Course evaluations

Students will need to complete an online evaluation of this course. Please take a few moments to complete the Faculty Evaluation when it is open later in the semester. Your feedback will prove helpful as we continue to develop this class. Thank you!
