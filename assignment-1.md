# Assignment One: Documentation

In this project, you will write a set of instructions for a technical process or field of knowledge, documenting each step so that your audience can successfully follow along. Assuming that your reader has a good base of general knowledge but not specific expertise in your field, you must document the task so that the reader can (if possessing the proper equipment) perform the task just as you would. Your documentation should be well-organized, clear, and comprehensive. Ideally, it should also display a little humor or personality to hold the attention of your audience. This assignment stresses *effective organization and translation of technical information*; you should come away from the project with a better grasp on these skills.

You will need to choose a process or domain of knowledge of sufficient complexity that it can sustain documentation of 1,000 words or so. (I am not fussed about specific word counts, and if your project comes in at 950 you won't be penalized for the word count. However, 1,000 words or more should be your target. The point is not to meet an arbitrary word count but to produce a sufficiently thorough document.) I recommend (but do not require) that you draw the material from your major coursework or your workstation on campus, so that you can work efficiently and draw on other material you are learning. 

Format the document according to what makes most sense for the material. For most tasks, this will probably be a step-by-step approach. ("First do this, then do that.") However, you could also submit a glossary or syntax guide, as in [our sample document by John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). **However,** all submissions *must* include the following two elements: an **Introduction** of two paragraphs giving an overview of the process and why your audience needs a guide to complete it, and a concluding **FAQ** section covering common questions and pitfalls. Between these two sections, the organization is up to you.

You may define the audience for this project as you see fit, whether you address your project to experts in the field (needing a reference guide for a process they already are familiar with), or position it as a guide for beginners or outsiders. Identify the audience in your introduction and tailor the whole guide to that group. 

**Do not** submit a recipe, which is its own genre and not sufficiently technical for this assignment. Also, you may not submit documentation on how to use any of the software tools we are employing in this class *unless* you address a very specific use case or otherwise make a major addition to the information already presented in the course. Examples of processes you might choose include: a guide to getting started with medical coding software, a step by step description of how to make a piece of stained glass, or a glossary covering terminology in agriculture.

**Be careful** not to merely replicate a set of instructions somebody else has written without modifying the audience, format, or scope. You could lapse into inadvertent plagiarism if you are working too closely from a source. I recommend working from multiple sources, but if you find one especially useful, you should deliberately modify your approach in some way, choosing a different audience, format, or style.

## Layout and Submission

Compose the document in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). You may include images or not, as you feel necessary. All documents for this assignment (topic, draft, and final submission) will live in your personal GitHub repo for this class. **If you have multiple repos (for instance, so you can experiment in one), please make sure to title your submission repo accordingly so I know which one to look at, and include your name somewhere so I can tell who you are.** As long as you are following the repo for our class, there is no need for any additional submission.

Cite all sources in a consistent style, using whatever style sheet you feel is appropriate. You may also choose to include a list of sources for your reader to reference that you do not necessarily cite in the document.

## Process and Deadlines

On topic commitment day, you must submit your chosen topic to me for approval. If you choose to change topics after that point, you **must** clear it with me at least 24 hours before final submission or the final project will receive an automatic 10% penalty. To propose your topic, you will submit a single paragraph of at least 25 words and no more than 100. You will not receive a letter grade on this piece; I will simply approve or offer feedback on your proposal. **Due**: 9.20

Prepare a full draft of your project for peer review and bring to class in hard copy. **Due**: 9.25

Final submission. **Due**: 9.27

## Rubric

The following rubric will be used to assess your grade. The final project is worth 200 points out of a total of 1,000 for the course.

**A.** *Outstanding* projects demonstrate a careful, detailed understanding of the process/knowledge in question as well as a thorough understanding of the audience. They adopt a format that makes it easy to follow the documentation, using headers, illustrations, or lists as appropriate. The language is sufficiently but not excessively technical, and demonstrates some element of personality or humor. Errors in mechanics (grammar, punctuation, Markdown syntax) are minimal at worst, and all submission procedures are followed.

**B.** Projects performing *significantly above* the basic requirements do all the required tasks but with a level of sophistication above the basic requirements. This means a thoughtful approach to audience and format and strong, clear prose. In general, they look like an outstanding essay but with less care in audience analysis, content knowledge, or format.

**C.** Projects *meeting the basic requirements* fulfill all submission requirements and meet the expectations of the project for content, form, audience awareness, and mechanics. However, they do not go beyond a basic understanding of the material or audience, or use format and language in a rigid, formulaic manner. They may also demonstrate significant mechanical errors, while remaining comprehensible to the reader.

**D.** Such projects demonstrate minimal effort and limited sophistication in handling the assignment. They may merely rehash a source, doing just enough to avoid plagiarism; they may manifest a superficial understanding of audience; or they may demonstrate limited content knowledge or confusion about the appropriate form for the material. Major mechanical errors that disrupt the reader's understanding of and sympathy for the project may also place a project in this bracket.

**F.** These projects fail to meet even the basic requirements, either through failure to follow the prompt, limited engagement with content or audience, or persistent lack of clarity in form or mechanics.
