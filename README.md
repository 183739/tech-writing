## Welcome to class

This GitHub repository will serve as home base for our class. It contains all the documents you need for the class, as well as the links to web readings. Once you have signed up for your own GitHub account, you can hit the "Watch" button in the upper right hand corner to be notified automatically when anything changes. 

Visit the file "syllabus.md" for an up-to-date version of the syllabus, and "links.md" for all links to handouts and readings.
