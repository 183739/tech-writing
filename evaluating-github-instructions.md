## Who are they?
1. We are they, we are the audience. Typical, handsome, college students trying to learn how to use GitHub.
2. Authors, publishers, editors, and writers are also the target audience. 
3. Government officials. 

## What do they know?
1. About GitHub? Nothing, we are slow learners determined to master our GitHub. 
2. They might have some prior knowledge, or might need a refresher on how GitHub works. They might also have no clue how it works and have a willingness to learn. 
3. Same as the people in number 1 and 2. 

## How will they read?
1. We will read with an open mind with an acceptance to new ideas and technology.
2. They will read with a prior knowledge and might understand a little more of the GitHub terminology.

The audience is beginners to GitHub. It seems like app developers, computer coders, and project creators use GitHub. They probably don't know much about the website yet. They'll need to read it carefully, step-by-step.
