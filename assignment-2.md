# Assignment Two: Technical Blog

In this assignment, you will configure and set up a science, technical, or industry blog focused on your area of interest. The site will educate readers on the field and help them understand how it affects their ordinary lives. It may be purely informational/educational, or it may have a component of serving as *content marketing* for a business or professional. By writing on a variety of topics relating to your field, you will gain further experience translating your technical expertise into accessible, helpful documents. You will also continue to gain familiarity with using modern web tools to promote and publish your work.

## Specifications

For this assignment, you will set up a blog on **either** [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) **or** [GitHub Pages](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages). We will continue to handle submission and peer review through GitHub, but you may choose to publish through either of these two blog platforms. Setting up a free Wordpress site is largely self-explanatory, while GitHub Pages is more complex but has other benefits in being backed up, Markdown-native, and highly responsive. Due to the added complexity of using GitHub Pages as well as my affection for it, I will offer a 6-point extra credit on the assignment for those who choose to employ that platform.

Define the scope of your blog carefully. Good specialty blogs (by which I mean those run by a single person, not a publisher or company) need a very specific, slightly unusual focus to be compelling to readers. Don't just write a general food blog: establish a specific focus (consider our example blog "Food Politics") or a surprising combination of topics (An example of that kind of setup, though not a blog I recommend as a model in general: ["Feedyard Foodie"](https://feedyardfoodie.wordpress.com/). The title definitely surprises.)

You will write various posts for the blog, in a variety of formats. Your first post should be **an introductory post**, defining what your blog offers readers and why it is worth reading. Is it an educational site? Does it aim to convince readers to view the industry a certain way? Do you want to show your readers "a day in the life" of a person in your field? A variety of approaches could work as long as your concept is clear and notable.

Other posts could translate new research in your field, respond to current news stories, tell stories, or discuss ideas in your field. (We'll discuss some blog post genres in class.) You can write a variety of post types (from highly technical to highly personal) depending on how you define the purpose of the blog.

Use media and design as appropriate for your site. Don't stick with the default formatting if you employ Wordpress: choose an appropriate theme. (If you use GitHub Pages, this is more complicated, and we can discuss that.) Add images and other media, always giving proper attribution through links.

Your research needs will vary depending on the type of blog you write. You may do conventional academic research. You may also need to gather online sources. For monitoring those, I recommend an RSS reader such as [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/) or [Feedly](https://feedly.com/i/pro/introduction). Finding blogs can be tricky, but I recommend using social media or search engines. I will also make available a list of food and farming blogs. 

To fulfill the assignment, your blog should have **a minimum of four posts,** an About page that tells your readers a little about you (this can be as anonymized as you like), and an attractive and easy-to-use look. Effective blog posts are usually in the range of 300-800 words apiece, though longer format pieces can be very effective, and if you decide to produce one of these we can discuss lowering the number of posts you submit. On the other hand, if you have some posts that are shorter (which can be totally legitimate in certain styles of blogging), plan to go beyond the minimum number of posts.

## Layout and Submission

Compose all materials in Markdown, as with our first assignment, and submit them to a repo on GitHub for in-class work. **Please create a new repo for this project and title it 01-My-Blog so I can find it more easily than I did your first projects.**

You will also produce a formatted blog on your platform of choice. For peer review and final submission, you can simply email that link to your peer and/or me.

## Deadlines

In addition to topic commitment, submission of the first two posts on your blog is staged through the unit. These posts may be further edited before final submission. They will be submitted through GitHub, and need only be added to your final site for peer review.

**Topic commitment** (in a paragraph, describe the focus and concept for your blog): 10.11

**First draft post due**: 10.18

**Second draft post due**: 10.25

**Draft due for peer review**: 10.30

**Final submission**: 11.1

## Rubric

The following rubric will be used to assess your grade. The final project is worth 200 points out of a total of 1,000 for the course.

A. Outstanding projects demonstrate a careful, detailed understanding of the your field and a strong concept for a blog that readers will actually want to read. They provide compelling content, whether educational, persuasive, or personal, with a strong authorial voice and relevant information. Each post has a reason for being and offers something distinct from others. Design choices are effective and thoughtful, and posts are written with effective titles and appropriate use of media. Errors in mechanics (grammar, punctuation, Markdown syntax) are minimal at worst, and all submission procedures are followed. 

B. Projects performing significantly above the basic requirements do all the required tasks but with a level of sophistication above the basic requirements. This means a thoughtful approach to the blog concept and strong, clear prose. In general, they look like an outstanding blog but with less care in audience analysis, content knowledge, or format.

C. Projects meeting the basic requirements fulfill all submission requirements and meet the expectations of the project for content, form, audience awareness, and mechanics. However, they do not go beyond a basic understanding of the material or audience, or use format and language in a rigid, formulaic manner. They may also demonstrate significant mechanical errors, while remaining comprehensible to the reader.

D. Such projects demonstrate minimal effort and limited sophistication in handling the assignment. They may merely rehash sources, doing just enough to avoid plagiarism; they may manifest a flimsy or overly broad blog concept; or they may demonstrate limited content knowledge or confusion about the appropriate form for the material. Major mechanical errors that disrupt the reader's understanding of and sympathy for the project may also place a project in this bracket.

F. These projects fail to meet even the basic requirements, either through failure to follow the prompt, limited engagement with content or audience, or persistent lack of clarity in form or mechanics.
