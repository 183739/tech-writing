Subject line: Web Strategist and Writer Job

Hey [company name],

I combine the critical-thinking skills of a classically-trained writer with the digital savvy of a Web native. (You're not likely to find another writer whose website references both Aristotle and @horse_ebooks.) After several years pursuing a career as a writing professor while freelancing in content marketing on the side, I'm looking for an opportunity to deploy those hybrids skills in creating world-class digital marketing. 

As I explore that job market, it's disheartening to see how few places get digital like you do. They are still looking for copywriters to do billboards, brochures - classic interruption marketing. My experience suggests that digital has much greater potential, as well as being more suited to my hybrid experience in writing and digital. Integrity gets the web-first game, as well as taking the strategic, analytical approach that my research background drives me toward.

I'm a versatile writer, a tech lover, a grammar geek and an independent thinker. My resume is attached, but you'll get a better sense of who I am by visiting my Web presence-slash-portfolio: [link]. If anything strikes your fancy, let's talk.
